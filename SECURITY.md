2. **Email** the same report to me@jaredwray.com with `[SECURITY]` in the subject line, and include the link to the issue you opened.

When reporting, please include as much of the following as you can:

## How this repository is secured

This repository follows the applicable items of the [defense-in-depth](https://github.com/jaredwray/agentic/blob/main/skills/security/defense-in-depth-nodejs/SKILL.md) hardening checklist; progress is tracked in [DEFENSE_IN_DEPTH.md](./DEFENSE_IN_DEPTH.md). Measures currently in place:

- CI jobs get read-only tokens, except the zizmor job, which can also upload results to code scanning; every action is pinned to a full commit SHA; checkouts do not keep credentials; workflows are security-linted with zizmor on every PR.
- The repository has no third-party dependencies. Socket reviews every dependency change; Aikido scans every build.
